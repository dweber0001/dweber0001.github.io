                           <h3 id="about">Brief summary of Gladys Aylward's courageous life:</h3>
                             <ul>
                             <li><b>1902</b> - Born in Edmonton, London, to parents  Thomas and Rosina, both postal workers </li>
                                         <li><b>1920</b> - She had her first spiritual experience at the age of 18</li>
                                         <li><b>1927</b> - She came across an article describing how people in China had not heard of the gospel and this article was what set her life course; she wanted to be a missionary</li>
                                         <li><b>1932</b> - She spent her savings to go to China. She was apprehended in Russia while on the 'Trans-Siberian Railway' but managed to escape and board a Japanese ship and made her way to Yangcheng, China</li>
                                         <li><b>1933</b> - She stayed with an elderly missionary, Jeannie Lawson, and learned the language, culture and wore the local dress (which she continued until she died). They rented an old inn and named it <i>The Inn of Eight Happinesses</i>. The inn provided shelter to travelers, preaching of the gospel, and Gladys soon found herself caring for a growing number of orphans. Her efforts at helping people earned her the name <b>Ai-weh-deh</b> which in Chinese means <b>Virtuous One</b></li>
                                         <li><b>1936</b> - She was appointed by local authorities as "foot inspector" to enforce the new law against footbinding of young girls in China</li>
                                                                                                                         <li><b>1937</b> - China had become involved in a bloody three-way conflict between the government, communist insurgents under Mao Tse Tung and an invading Japanese army. Wanting to identify with those she served, Gladys became a Chinese citizen. She found herself behind enemy lines, and eventually wound up on a Japanese 'Wanted' poster. She realized she needed to get her orphans away from the fighting and led more than 100 orphans on a grueling 27 day trek across the mountains to safety in Sian</li>
                                                                                                                         <li><b>1949</b> - Gladys' health was affected by the trip and she returned to England. She wanted to return to China and sought approval, however, the new communist government was opposed to Christianity, and she was rejected. She gave many lectures about her experience and work while in England</li>
                                                                                                                        <li><b>1958</b> - She went to Hong Kong before settling  in Taiwan, where she set up the 'Gladys Aylward Orphanage' and worked extensively in Taiwan for the poor through the 'Gladys Aylward Children's Home' for the remaining years of her life</li>
                                                                                                                         <li><b>1970</b> - Gladys Aylward died of influenza at the age of 67 in Taiwan. Gladys never married, but she adopted five children. There is no way to count how many unofficial children she adopted during her lifetime</li>
                                                                                                                         <blockquote cite="https://www.encyclopedia.com/women/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/aylward-gladys-1902-1970"><p>"Life is pitiful, death so familiar, suffering and pain so common, yet I would not be anywhere else."</p><cite>-- Gladys Aylward, during the Japanese occupation of China</cite></blockquote>
