# Hello! 

My name is **Denise Weber** and I am very happy you are here! I have an associate's degree in Software Development and I am interested in learning and growing my skills in development and design. I am looking for an entry level position with a great company where I can contribute, learn and grow long-term. I live and work remotely near Green, Ohio.

After many years spent working in the field of medical records, my team was laid off due to offshoring and I was given the opportunity to pursue an associate degree in Software Development through the Trade Administration. I am now looking for an opportunity to combine previous work experience with my learned skills in development and to continue to learn and grow my skills.  After graduation I have been pursuing further knowledge with additional online learning. I love developing websites and applications, and I am passionate about technology, learning and taking on challenges. Please look around and view links to my GitHub and work I have done showing some of my capabilities. My other interests are design, travel, photography, my faith, family, friends **_...and sunsets!_**
