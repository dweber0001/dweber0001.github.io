```After many years spent working in medical records; I am changing careers and transitioning to web development after going back to school for software development. I have spent the last 3 years obtaining my AS degree and then furthering my knowledge with additional online learning. I love developing websites and applications and I am passionate about technology, learning and taking on challenges. Please look around and view links to my GitHub and work I have done showing some of my capabilities. I am looking for an entry level position with a company where I can contribute, learn and grow long-term.  My other interests are design, travel, photography, my faith, family, friends...and sunsets!```
